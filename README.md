# Justin Yanke's Computer and Computer Science Crash Course

A resource directory designed to help you understand computers and computer science better.

"Learn to Learn"
  - Vince, my awesome software engineering teacher
Once you learn to learn, then all you need to do is figure out where to look. Knowing where to look is my primary objective in this space.

This course is a compilation of resources for learning both beginner and then advanced computer science concepts at a quick pace. It's designed for a couple of months' commitment with a focus on guiding you to deeper knowledge as your understanding evolves.

Your feedback is crucial to making this as helpful as possible! Please open a GitHub Issue for inaccuracies, complaints, comments, discussion, clarity requests, etc. For changes to the readme, feel free to submit a Pull Request and it will be considered. Eventually discussion and questions may be moved elsewhere, i'm open to suggestions.
