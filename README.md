# Justin Yanke's Computer Crash Course, a directory of resources with some direction and notes designed to help you understand computers and computer science better
 As my software engineering teacher in high school said: "learn to learn". Then all you need to do is figure out where to look.
 Teaching you where to look is something I have some good knowledge on.

The purpose of these resources is to provide you with the ability to learn beginner and advanced concepts for computer science with a very quick pace, while allowing high replayability.
I'm putting this resource together for those of you wanting a couple-of-months commitment to learning about this complicated subject with a particular focus on learning where to look to dive deeper as you begin to understand these thingsbetter.

Expect me to continuously improve this brief course. Feel free to open a Github Issue ticket to point out inaccuracies, complaints, comments, discussion, clarity requests, etc.

Feel free to open a "Pull Request" to submit change suggestions.

##Week 1-2: Getting started: Understanding Computers
        
#Week 1: Understanding Computers üñ•Ô∏è
	Day 1-2: Introduction to Computers

    Objective: Explore what computer science is and their historical evolution.
    Topics:
        The definition of a computer and its historical context.
        Understanding the basic components and types of computers.
    Personal Notes: I spoke to some people that work at Microsoft at a fairly-recent developer conference. Teaching children programming is clearly a high priority to them. Consequently, many amazing videos have been created with a focus towards people that may have not been introduced to computers in great depth. Enjoy videos and other resources below for a good introduction to what computer science is.
